## Introduction

As an e-commerce company selling a wide range of electronics and accessories, understanding customer purchasing patterns and product performance is crucial for driving revenue growth and making informed business decisions. This project leverages sales data to identify top-selling products, peak sales periods, regional sales variations, frequently purchased product combinations, and optimal pricing strategies.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries were used in this analysis:

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

## Data

The analysis is based on a comprehensive sales dataset containing information such as order IDs, product details, quantities ordered, prices, order dates, and purchase addresses.

## Analysis

The analysis consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new features (e.g., month, date, city) for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing sales distribution across months, cities, and hours of the day to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Product Analysis**: Examining top-selling products, frequently purchased product combinations, and the correlation between pricing and sales volumes.
4. **Regional Analysis**: Analyzing sales performance across different cities and regions.

## Results

The analysis revealed several key insights, including:

- The month with the highest sales was December.
- San Francisco was the city with the highest sales volume.
- The optimal time for advertising and promotions is between 11 AM and 2 PM, when sales reach their peak.
- The top-selling product was AAA Batteries (4-pack), likely due to its low price point and strategic placement at checkout areas.
- Frequently purchased product combinations included Google Phone + USB-C Charging Cable, iPhone + Charging Cables, and more.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, several recommendations were provided to the stakeholders, including:

- Increase promotions and merchandising for low-priced, high-volume products like batteries and charging cables near checkout areas.
- Run targeted advertising campaigns and promotions during peak sales hours.
- Offer bundled pricing for frequently purchased product combinations.
- Explore increasing product inventory and retail locations in high-sales cities like San Francisco.
- Conduct further analysis on pricing elasticity to identify optimal price points for different product categories.

## Future Work

- Incorporate customer demographic data to uncover additional insights and personalize marketing strategies.
- Explore machine learning techniques for demand forecasting and product recommendation systems.
- Integrate sentiment analysis on customer reviews to identify areas for product and service improvements.
- Develop interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring and visualization of sales performance.
